# SopherApps

SopherApps is an organization for building small usable software for technical workers like engineers, data scientists etc.

## Origins

SopherApps is a word formed from "Philosopher" and "Applications". It originates from my first blog called "ultipmatephilosophy.net".

## Purpose

To show God's magnificence through simple day-to-day software.

>> For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes:
>> first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.

>> -- Romans 1: 16
